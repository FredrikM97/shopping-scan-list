# Shopping Scan List

## About

This is a plugin for home assistant to scan items with the barcode to add them to a shopping list. This plugin is based on the todo lists to store information so no other integration is needed.

**DISCLAMER**
This is very early development and I might rewrite everything again depending on the structure. This is in experimental phase to figure which direction I want to structure it in.

## Development

Simplest to UI test is to use `npm run setup` to start local docker container with home assistant. To update the card run `npm run build:ha`
