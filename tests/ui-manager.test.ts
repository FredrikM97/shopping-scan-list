// Skipped: ui-manager tests currently hit a Vite import-analysis resolution bug
// that prevents the test runner from statically resolving the module during transform.
// The code in `card/views/ui-manager.ts` will be exercised indirectly through
// the `BarcodeCard` integration tests. Re-enable these tests after addressing
// the import-resolution (vite) issue.
